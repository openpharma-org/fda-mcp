## Dates and ranges

The openFDA API supports searching by _range_ in date, numeric, or string fields.

  * Specify an _inclusive_ range by using square brackets `[min+TO+max]`. These include the values in the range. For example, `[1+TO+5]` will match **1** through **5**.
  * Dates are simple to search by via range. For instance, `[2004-01-01+TO+2005-01-01]` will search for records between Jan 1, 2004 and Jan 1, 2005.
